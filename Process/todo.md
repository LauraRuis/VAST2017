- legend for node size (buggy)
- update connections

# brush slider
- add all the weeks (instead of only 1-22 of 2016)
- doesnt work when scrolled down

# table
- link with parallel coordinates
- on click for details automatically scroll up to see graph
- on row click show vars of that ID in parallel coordinates (selected get colored) (NB; is this necessary? Also visable in table)

# parallel coordinates

- on double click all lines blue again (works, but buggy)
