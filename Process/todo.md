# Overall
- ask for way to work around variable scope issues
- ask about problem of on first click class does not get set but on second click it does (selection of route in graph)

# graph
- legend for node size (buggy)

# brush slider
- doesnt work when scrolled down

# table
- NB; period of stay is not yet correct (first and second entry of entrance instead of first and last)
- selection of path in PC buggy

# parallel coordinates
- on double click all lines blue again (works, but buggy)

# line chart
- style checkboxes
