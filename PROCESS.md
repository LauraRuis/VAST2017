# Day 1
Started with meeting with project partners Sven and Peter and with Gosia to discuss the VAST Challenge and the approach we will take to solving the problem. 

Decided that two things have to be tackled before starting on answering the questions:
1. Exploring the data with simple plots
2. Reading in the map of the nature preserve

When this is done we can all start on our own part of the project. I will focus on a graph visualization and two related visualizations.

Also wrote proposal today in README.md.

*Summary of day 1*:
- Started on decision process on how to tackle challenge
- Divided work to be done
- Decided on stand-up meetings with Gosia every monday, tuesday and wednesday.
