## Introduction to problem
Analyzing traffic movement in a nature preserve for a ornithologist that needs to examine the reason for a decline in nesting of a certain bird that has its habitat in the preserve. In summary, the questions to be answered are the following (for the full questions, again see: http://vacommunity.org/VAST+Challenge+2017+MC1):
1. Describe up to six daily patterns of life by vehicles traveling through and within the park (kind of vehicles, spatial activities, temporal activities). Please limit your answer to six images and 500 words.
2. Describe up to six patterns of life that occur over multiple days by vehicles traveling through and within the park. Please limit your answer to six images and 500 words.
3. Describe up to six unusual patterns and highlight why you find them unusual. Please limit your answer to six images and 500 words.
4. What are the top 3 patterns you discovered that you suspect could be most impactful to bird life in the nature preserve?
